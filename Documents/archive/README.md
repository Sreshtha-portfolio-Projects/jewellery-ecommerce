Outdated or superseded documentation moved here during cleanup.

- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** – Old high-level summary (many “not implemented” items are now done).
- **phase.md** – Post-payment feature roadmap / prompts.
- **phase2.md**, **phase3.md** – Returns & refunds Cursor prompts (skeleton and full).

For current setup and reference, use the main docs in `Documents/` (e.g. SETUP.md, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, RAZORPAY_PAYMENT_INTEGRATION.md, CHECKOUT_SYSTEM_FIXES.md, LOCAL_VS_PRODUCTION_AND_403.md).
